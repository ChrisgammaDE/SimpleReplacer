# SimpleReplacer

With this tool you can easily replace strings in files.

## How to use
1. Download the current zip from [releases](https://github.com/ChrisgammaDE/SimpleReplacer/releases)
2. Extract the zip to a place you would like to work in
3. Copy your `.txt` file into the folder
4. Edit the `mappings.txt`, so that everything you want to be relpaced get's replaced
5. Execute the `App.exe` and enter the filename of your `.txt` file

Here is a example of me using this app:

## Legal note
I try my best to keep this working, but:
- You do this at your own risk
- I will not fix your computer when you break it
- This is a sunday-evening project, so don't use this in production
